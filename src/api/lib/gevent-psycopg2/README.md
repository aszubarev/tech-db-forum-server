  [psycogreen]: https://bitbucket.org/dvarrazzo/psycogreen/src/77a9c05f5229/gevent/psyco_gevent.py


## Installation

    pip install gevent-psycopg2


## Usage

Before attempting to connect to the database:

This has been manually confirmed to work with Django, when using psycopg2 as
the database backend.
